# DCS-pcall
As Eagle Dynamics has continually made undocumented changes to the DCS Mission Scripting Environments API it has caused a large amount of technical debt to maintain older scripts. This repo hopes to lower the risk and requirement for you to re-write your code when ever these undocumented changes occur.

The aim for this project is to provide a pcall protected set of functions that match the commands made available the DCS World Mission Scripting Environment.

# Shout-Out
Thanks to OfficialyInsane for helping me understand the importance of having a capability like this for the DCS community.

Also shout out to the team over at Hoggit that maintain the best command reference for all of the DCS-API's. Without this resource this would not be possible.
