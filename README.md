# DCS-pcall
As Eagle Dynamics has continually made undocumented changes to the DCS Mission Scripting Environments API it has caused a large amount of technical debt to maintain older scripts without the need to re-write your code.

The aim for this project is to provide a pcall protected set of functions that match the commands made available the DCS World Mission Scripting Environment.


# Shout-Out
Thanks to [OfficialyInsane](https://github.com/officialyinsane) for helping me understand the importance of having a capability like this for the DCS community.
